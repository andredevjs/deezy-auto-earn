note you may want to make the following edits to the `deezy-auto-earn-example.service` file:

- change username from `ubuntu` to your user
- update `RestartSec` to your desired interval, which will determine how frequently the script runs

```
sudo cp deezy-auto-earn-example.service /etc/systemd/system/deezy-auto-earn.service
sudo systemctl enable deezy-auto-earn.service
sudo systemctl start deezy-auto-earn
```

note, doing `enable` means it will always start up when your machine restarts

to follow the logs:

```
journalctl -fu deezy-auto-earn -n 100

```
sudo systemctl stop deezy-auto-earn
```
